    Enable Barbican Secrets Support for Glance in OpenStack-Ansible.
    Glance was not being configured to use Barbican for secret management when Barbican support was enabled.
    This patch ensures that Glance is efficiently configured to interact with Barbican and allowing proper handling of secrets (such as image encryption keys) in OpenStack environments.
